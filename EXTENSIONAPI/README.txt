To build:

Place the downloaded .jar's in ../../lib (compared to this README)

Open project in IntelliJ IDEA

Find the Gradle View (to the right, next to Ant, Maven, Database, etc.)

Click the "Refresh Icon"

The .jar's will now load, and you can run assemble, etc., via the Gradle View to the right.

Assemble creates the .jar that contains the component created.
