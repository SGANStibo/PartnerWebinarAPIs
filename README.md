# PartnerWebinarAPIs
The repository contains demo code from the Stibo Systems Partner Webinar, 15-03-2017. The code is intended for demo purposes of the STEP APIs only, not for usage in production-systems. The main purpose of these samples are to give the most simple, basic, first-view examples of what can be done via the STEP APIs.

Where projects have been created, IntelliJ IDEA has been used (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), though some sub-folders just contain simple files, not projects.
