# EXTENSION API
A demonstration of a single usage of the STEP Extension API - here used to make a custom Input Field.

# USAGE

* Place the downloaded Extension API .jar's in ../../lib (compared to this README). The .jar's are available to download from a STEP system with the Extension API License.
* Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
* Find the Gradle View (to the right, next to Ant, Maven, Database, etc.)
* Click the "Refresh"-Icon

The .jar's will now load, and you can run assemble, etc., via the Gradle View to the right.

Assemble creates the .jar that contains the component created, which can then be patched onto a test system.
